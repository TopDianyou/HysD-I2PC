HysD-I2PC: Image-to-Point Cloud Registration for Hysteretic Damage Prediction in Semi-Rigid PC Joints

This repository contains the official implementation of HysD-I2PC, a novel registration network designed for end-to-end pose estimation and temporal damage prediction in semi-rigid precast concrete (PC) joints under cyclic loading.

Key Features

Image-Point Cloud Registration: Integrates ResNet-Transformer and Point Transformer for robust feature extraction from images and point clouds.

Cross-Dimensional Fusion: Effectively combines image and point cloud features through a cross-modal fusion mechanism.

Damage Prediction: Incorporates a damage-driven bidirectional LSTM branch for accurate temporal damage state prediction.
